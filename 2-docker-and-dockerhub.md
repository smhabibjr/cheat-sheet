add Dockerfile to your project directory

````docker
FROM ruby:3.1
RUN apt-get update -yqq
RUN apt-get install -yqq --no-install-recommends nodejs
COPY . /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN bundle
````

Open the command line and type the below command to build our first image
````sh
docker build .
````

After that, we need to check whether our app image builds or not. To check it run the command below.
````sh
docker images
````

Docker build command doesn't run the image. To run newly created image we need to execute this command.

````sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 5b450be52d9b rails s -b 0.0.0.0
````

Now you can see it on localhost:3000
